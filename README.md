## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patbil/personal-site.git
   cd personal-site
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - No build process or npm installation required - the site works out of the box

## Development

### Project Organization

The codebase follows a clean architecture:

- SCSS files use the 7-1 pattern with modular components
- JavaScript remains lightweight and framework-free
- Single compiled CSS file for optimal performance

### Modifying Styles

Edit SCSS files in the `scss/` directory and compile:

```bash
npx sass scss:css --no-source-map
```

Or use npm script if configured:

```bash
npm run sass
```

## Deployment

Deployed via GitHub Pages with custom domain.

### Automatic Deployment

Simply push to `main` branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages rebuilds the site automatically. The CNAME file ensures the custom domain is preserved.
